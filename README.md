# FAME
This repository contains the notes I prepared as a teaching fellow for Eli Fenichel's Fundamentals of Applied Math for Environmental Scientists Course at the Yale School of the Environment in the Fall of 2025. 

The repository has two primary folders, `class notes` and `section notes`. The class notes are taken during Eli's in-class lectures. I prepare my section notes for my Tuesday evening sections. I do not expect you to read the section notes before the section. However, they can be helpful to have in front of you during section. 

Note: You can ignore the .tex files. The PDFs are what are viewable and what you want! The .tex files are just how I make the pdfs. 


### Office hours
My office hours are Tuesdays from 5:00 - 6:30 p.m. in Sage 41C. The first half will typically be my prepared material, which will prepare you for the problem sets. The second half will be open office hours, when I can answer any questions.

### Week One (Oct 21)

-  [class notes](class_notes/week_1/1_class.pdf): Course goals, science vs. math, sets (elements, subsets, unions, intersections), number spaces (real, rational, integers), functions (explicit vs. implicit, domain/range, endogenous vs. exogenous variables), equilibrium concepts, mathematical properties (commutative, associative, distributive), convex sets versus concave and convex functions, solving a system of equations (including pset example), quadratic formula, jensen's inequality 
-  [Old section notes](section_notes/1_section.pdf): sets, solving system of equations, quadratic equations, domain/range
