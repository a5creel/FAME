# FAME
This repository contains the notes I prepared as a teaching fellow for Eli Fenichel's Fundamentals of Applied Math for Environmental Scientists Course at the Yale School of the Environment in the Fall of 2025. 

The repository has two primary folders, `class notes` and `section notes`. The class notes are taken during Eli's in-class lectures. I prepare my section notes for my Tuesday evening sections. I do not expect you to read the section notes before the section. However, they can be helpful to have in front of you during section. 

Note: You can ignore the .tex files. The PDFs are what are viewable and what you want! The .tex files are just how I make the pdfs. 


### Office hours
My office hours are Tuesdays from 5:00 - 6:30 p.m. in Sage 41C. The first half will typically be my prepared material, which will prepare you for the problem sets. The second half will be open office hours, when I can answer any questions.

# Preliminaries 

### Week One (Oct 21) -- Preliminaries

-  [class notes](class_notes/week_1/1_class.pdf): Course goals, science vs. math, sets (elements, subsets, unions, intersections), number spaces (real, rational, integers), functions (explicit vs. implicit, domain/range, endogenous vs. exogenous variables), equilibrium concepts, mathematical properties (commutative, associative, distributive), convex sets versus concave and convex functions, solving a system of equations (including pset example), quadratic formula, jensen's inequality 
-  [Old section notes](section_notes/1_section.pdf): sets, solving system of equations, quadratic equations, domain/range

### Week Two (Oct 28) -- Derivatives I 

-  [class notes](class_notes/week_2/2_class.pdf): Sequences and series (definitions, limits, monotonicity, bounds), infinity as a concept (countable vs. uncountable), relationships between variables and linear approximation, intermediate value theorem (motivation for collecting more data), definition of a derivative (as instantaneous slope or rate of change), derivative notation (Leibniz, Newton, and prime forms), first and second derivatives (interpreting slope and curvature), power rule, chain rule, and product rule (core differentiation tools), logarithmic differentiation and percent change (relative vs. absolute units), and the constant e (derived from a limit definition and linked to exponential growth). Concludes with examples of how to do u-subs, chain rule and log rules.

### Week Three (Nov 4) -- Derivatives II 

-  [class notes](class_notes/week_3/3_class.pdf): Maxima and minima (using first and second derivatives to identify peaks and valleys), deriving the mean by minimizing squared distances (link between calculus and averages), connection between least squares and linear regression (pset hint), Mean Value Theorem (derivative equals average rate of change), Taylor Series (polynomial approximations of functions, from 0th-order means to higher-order curves), practical approximations (e.g., estimating √10 or deriving logistic growth from Taylor expansion), partial derivatives (holding one variable constant to find relative maxima/minima), total derivatives (combining effects of multiple changing variables), and the implicit function theorem (how one variable must change to hold another constant, foundation for the envelope theorem in economics).
